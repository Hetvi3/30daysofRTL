# Day 4 - Ripple Carry Adder

## ðŸ“˜ Description
Implements a 4-bit **Ripple Carry Adder** using Full Adders connected in series. This circuit is foundational in multi-bit binary addition.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Language
- Verilog HDL
- Simulated using ModelSim

## ðŸ’¡ Concept
Carries propagate from one stage to the next, creating delay in large-bit-width circuits.
