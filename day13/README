# Day 13 - JK Flip-Flop (Synchronous & Asynchronous)

## ðŸ“˜ Description
Verilog-based implementation of **JK Flip-Flops** with both synchronous and asynchronous resets.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Language
- Verilog HDL
- Simulated using ModelSim

## ðŸ’¡ Concept
JK flip-flop eliminates invalid states in SR FF and supports toggling.

## ðŸ’¬ Notes
Commonly used in counters and FSMs.
