# Day 1 - Half Adder

## ðŸ“˜ Description
This module implements a Verilog-based design for **Half Adder**. It forms a key part of combinational logic understanding and is commonly used in digital circuit design.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Language
- Verilog HDL
- Simulated using ModelSim 

## âœ… Functional Description
This design covers the expected logical behavior of a **Half Adder** in hardware.

## ðŸ§ª Testing
Testbench created to verify all input combinations and edge cases for `Half Adder`.
Ensure:
- Functional correctness
- Valid waveform generation (optional)

## ðŸ’¬ Notes
This design is part of the `30DaysOfRTL` Verilog series.
