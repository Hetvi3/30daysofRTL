# Day 14 - D Flip-Flop (Synchronous & Asynchronous)

## ðŸ“˜ Description
Implements **D Flip-Flops** in both synchronous and asynchronous variants.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Language
- Verilog HDL
- Simulated using ModelSim

## ðŸ’¡ Concept
Captures the value of `D` on the clock edge and stores it.

## ðŸ’¬ Notes
Most commonly used flip-flop in design of registers and memory elements.
