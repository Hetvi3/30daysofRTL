# Day 7 - Multiplexers (2:1, 4:1, 3:1)

## ðŸ“˜ Description
This folder contains Verilog implementations of **2:1**, **4:1**, and **3:1 Multiplexers** including 4:1 using 2:1 structure.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Language
- Verilog HDL
- Simulated using ModelSim

## ðŸ’¡ Concept
A multiplexer selects one of several input signals and forwards it to a single output line.

## ðŸ’¬ Notes
Helps reinforce data routing concepts in hardware design.
