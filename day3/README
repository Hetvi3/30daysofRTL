# Day 3 - Half & Full Subtractor

## ðŸ“˜ Description
This module contains Verilog designs for both **Half Subtractor** and **Full Subtractor** used in binary arithmetic operations.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Language
- Verilog HDL
- Simulated using ModelSim

## ðŸ§® Logic Formula
**Half Subtractor**:
Diff = A ^ B
Borrow = ~A & B

**Full Subtractor**:
Diff = A ^ B ^ Bin
Borrow = (A & B) | ((A ^ B) & Bin)
