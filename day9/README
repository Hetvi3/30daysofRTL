# Day 9 - 8:3 Binary Encoder

## ğŸ“˜ Description
Implements an **8:3 Binary Encoder** using Verilog HDL, converting 8 input lines into a 3-bit binary representation.

## ğŸ”§ Tools & Language
- Verilog HDL
- Simulated using ModelSim

## ğŸ’¡ Concept
Used in digital systems where fewer output lines are needed to represent many inputs.

## ğŸ’¬ Notes
Essential for reducing data width in digital communication.
